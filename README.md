### Personal Projects ([**Link to repository**](https://github.com/ChengWeiKuang/DataAnalytics))  
**Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification**  
- **Summary**: This project aims to create a predictive model for predictive maintenance for a milling machine based on its historical data. Here, data exploration is first done to understand more about the dataset, as well as getting some preliminary insights on the factors that causes the machine failures to occur. Then, various machine learning and deep learning models are built, in an attempt to find out a model that can perform the prediction with the best performance. By the end of the project, one of the models is able to perform the prediction with an accuracy of 98.33% and an F1-score of 71.49%.  
- **Dataset**: Synthetic dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020).  
- **Tools Used**: Python.  
- **Skills Involved**: Data Visualization (Matplotlib, seaborn), Machine Learning (scikit-learn), Deep Learning (Tensorflow).

**Production Data Processing and Dashboard**  
- **Summary**: This project is created as a simulated use case of how a manufacturing company can possibly create a dashboard to monitor the performance of their production line. As real-world data is usually confidential and difficult to obtain, some synthetic data is generated with Python instead. Then, assuming that the actual data is already available in an SQL database, an SQL script is used to process the raw data and updates the summary data in a few separate table in the same database. Finally, a dashboard is created with Power BI, for the engineers to analyze and monitor the performance of their products and test processes on the same platform.  
- **Dataset**: Self-generated synthetic dataset.  
- **Tools Used**: Python, SQL, Power BI.  
- **Skills Involved**: Data Processing, Data Visualization (Power BI).

**Web Scraper - eCommerce Site**
- **Summary**: This is just a simple web scraper created to extract information from a "dummy" eCommerce website, in which there is no way to download the data directly, and there is no publicly available API for it. Similar tools can be created for competitor intelligence purpose, so that a company can utilize some publicly available information to understand more about their competitor's business and performance.   
- **Dataset**: Scraped from the [Test Site](https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/ajax).  
- **Tools Used**: Python.  
- **Skills Used**: Web Scraping (Selenium).
